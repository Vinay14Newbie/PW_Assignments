BEM (block, element, modifier)

In this i've used two paragraph and one photo section.
For each section i've used different class names by keeping amazon as a prefix name.

In that i've divided images in two parts:
1) amazon trees
2) amazon waterfall
In total i've used all block, element, modifier naming to the classes
