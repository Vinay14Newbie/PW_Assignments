Common differences

Layout Control:
Flexbox: It is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column. It's good for aligning items along a single axis.
Grid: Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to define both rows and columns. It is used for complex layouts with rows and columns.

Direction:
Flexbox: Works along either the horizontal or vertical axis.
Grid: Works in two dimensions, so it allows you to create both rows and columns simultaneously.

Alignment:
Flexbox: Excellent for aligning items along the main axis or the cross axis, making it suitable for centering items or creating flexible, equal-height/width containers.
Grid: It have extensive control over the placement of items in both rows and columns, making it suitable for creating grids and more complex layouts.
