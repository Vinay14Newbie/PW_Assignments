Q2  Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.


1)  Absolute positioning:
-Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal flow and positions it relative to a specified ancestor or the viewport, without affecting the layout of other elements.
-You can use properties like 'top', 'right', 'bottom' and 'left' to specify the exact position of the element.


2)  Relative positioning:
-It doesn't affect the siblings element while moving the other positions.
-Relative positioning used in combination with prooperties like top, right, bottom and left to make fine adjustents to the position we required.
