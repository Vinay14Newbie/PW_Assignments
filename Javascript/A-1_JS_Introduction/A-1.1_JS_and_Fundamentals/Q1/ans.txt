Q1  Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.


JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily employed for web development. It is a high-level, interpreted programming language that allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.

Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is mainly executed on the client side, meaning it runs in a user's web browser rather than on the server.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. 

1) Interactivity: JavaScript enables the creation of interactive features on web pages, such as form validation, image sliders, and pop-up windows. 

2) DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects. JavaScript allows developers to manipulate the DOM, enabling dynamic changes to the content and structure of a webpage. 

3) Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await. This is essential for handling tasks such as fetching data from servers, making API calls, and performing other operations without blocking the execution of the rest of the code.

4) Frameworks and Libraries: There are numerous JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that simplify the development of complex web applications. 

5) Server-Side Development: With the advent of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. 

6) Cross-Platform Development: JavaScript is not limited to web browsers. It can be used in various environments, including mobile app development (using frameworks like React Native or Ionic) and desktop application development (using tools like Electron).
